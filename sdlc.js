// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning : This first phase involves the planning of the projects goals and requirments along with the scope of the project.
// Analysis of Requirements: This phase has you gather detailed requirments and then analize documnets and priortize expectations.
// Design: This phase has you turn the requirments in to software "blue prints" and has you address the functionality, performace, security, and scalabilty aspects of the software program.
// Implementation: This phase is where the code is written and built according the according to the design specs.
// Testing & Integration: This phase is where the software is tested and preforms correctly and to design specs. This is where bugs are found and fixed.
// Maintain: This phase is happens after the software is released and has you taking information about protention problems and has to you address them. You will also will be continually be updating and improving the software in this phase.
